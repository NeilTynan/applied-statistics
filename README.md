## About this Project


## Use of this Project

This repository may be of some interest to other students engaged in similar coursework around statistics. Feel free to use whatever you like from it (though if another party has been referenced, I would ask that you likewise cite them).


## Getting Started

The workbook is structured in a linear fashion, so reading through it from start to finish is the best approach.

To understand how the workbook has developped to date, please see below a timeline of the work done on the notebook and the material referenced in the course of this work:

- 06/10/2025 - Created ReadMe and Gitignore file. Gitignore file generated using the template at Python gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore, the Windows gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/Windows.gitignore, the MacOS gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/macOS.gitignore and the Linux gitignore template at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/Linux.gitignore.
- 10/10 - Created problems.ipynb. Added libraries based off lecture 16-notebook-overview. Other coursework referenced included: Started work on problem 1. 15-lady-tasting-tea-intro, 17-permutations-and-combinations.
- 14/10 - Continued work on problem 1. Coursework referenced included: 18-choose-function, 19-counting-possibilities, 20-hypothesis-testing.
- 15/10 - Finished up analysis of Problem 1. Added in some explanatory text to improve readability. External materials referenced: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/introduction-to-python-tabulate-library/ (how to use tabulate to return tuples as tables), https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/formatted-string-literals-f-strings-python/ (f strings in python), https://martintaggart.com/how-to-determine-statistical-significance-using-p-values/ (what is a p-value and how to select it).
- 27/10 - Started work on problem 2. Outlined the problem and focussed on trying to generate the sample data Coursework referenced included:
- 04/11 - Briefly continued work on problem 2. Attempted to complete
- 24/11 - Continued work on problem 2, referencing more external material. Completed work on computing the standard deviation and started the problem analysis. External materials referenced included. https://tidystat.com/how-to-calculate-standard-deviation-in-python-numpy/ (How to plot the standard deviation in Python)
- 26/11 - Finished up analysis of problem 2. Finsihed up the analysis and added in some additional text and formatting to improve readability. External materials referenced.https://www.statology.org/population-vs-sample-standard-deviation/ (Population SD vs Sample SD)
- 27/11 - In order to justify the conclusion to problem 2, went back and added a section where the anaysis was tested with a second histogram.
- 08/12 - Started work on problem 3. Generated the samples data for graphing, in line with the problem description. External material referenced includes: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html (how to preform an independent t-test).
- 09/12 - Continued work on problem 3, adding in the graph and some more expalantory text.
- 15/12 - Completed the final part of problem 3, explaining the changes in the type 2 error rate. Added in more explanatory text and annotations to problem 3 and also adjusted some of the formating in the notebook to make it more readable. External material referenced included: https://www.simplypsychology.org/type_i_and_type_ii_errors.html (what are type 1 and type 2 errors), https://www.statisticalaid.com/type-i-and-type-ii-errors/ (impact of the effect size on type 2 error rate).
